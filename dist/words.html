thick chunked remains of smashed glass, next to one spherical, transparent, glass marble

wake up to canopy of fresh green leaves, clothes thick with wood smoke

a penultimate fluctuation of green shades of foliage

floor of fallen blossom vs. a grass carpet

floating planet

write down vs. type up

cannot hide from the eyes of a child

japanese neon carousel & electric church

an endless quest for infinite knowledge

dracula rapture & transylvania

curious to think of life as a film, so engulfed in your part that you don't stop to think the script could already be written

skeletal existence

death feels an eternity away - so much so it is as if not even inevitable. meaning is forever astray, out of focus somewhere in the background. as life continues, glints of purpose appear suddenly and disappear just as quickly. dormant in forgotten memories that come together here and there

a shadow - death follows
