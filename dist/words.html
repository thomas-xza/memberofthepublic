<h3>WORDS</h3>


thick chunked remains of smashed glass, next to one spherical, transparent, glass marble
<br><br>

wake up to canopy of fresh green leaves, clothes thick with wood smoke
<br><br>

a penultimate fluctuation of green shades of foliage
<br><br>

floor of fallen blossom vs. a grass carpet
<br><br>

floating planet
<br><br>

write down vs. type up
<br><br>

japanese neon carousel & electric church
<br><br>

an endless quest for infinite knowledge
<br><br>

dracula rapture & transylvania
<br><br>

curious to think of life as a film, so engulfed in your part that you don't stop to think the script could already be written
<br><br>

skeletal existence
<br><br>


a shadow - death follows
