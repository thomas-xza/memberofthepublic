perhaps
a large indoor maze - entirely pitch black

perhaps
a wooden chair coated entirely in moss. with a chunky cushion made entirely of moss

perhaps
an all white room. with a sphere hanging from the middle, that explodes colours all over the walls

perhaps
a lightbulb in the centre of a glass sphere, as translucent paint runs around the glass, and the colours are projected all around the room

perhaps
a traditionally shaped castle, made entirely of geometrically patterned cards

perhaps
a jigsaw puzzle of entirely blank white pieces

perhaps
a naked man surrounded by masses of mouse traps fixed to the ground

perhaps
the box of a computer made entirely of full transparent glass. if all electronics had a transparent chassis

perhaps
a time lapse of ivy over a large period of time as it grows across a wall

perhaps
a bath of fish. and an assortment of other objects

perhaps
scissors you could wear on your fingers

...
or perhaps not
