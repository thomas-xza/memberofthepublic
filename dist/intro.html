  <h2>INTRO</h2>

	This website was originally created at
	https://cargocollective.com/memberofthepublic, based on art I
	had created circa 2011 - 2015.<br>

	It remained dormant a long time, but I remained satisfied with
	the quality.<br>

	More recently (~2024) I experimented with a new medium - loops
	- and thought them good enough for this website.<br>

	But, there were issues with the old hosting provider (AVIF
	file formats rejected); and so,
	I <a href="https://github.com/thomas-xza/memberofthepublic">rebuilt
	the website</a> from scratch, and am now hosting it on big
	tech platforms, in hopes of greater longevity.<br><br>
