    <h2>IDEAS</h2>

    perhaps<br>
    a large indoor maze - entirely pitch black

    <br><br>perhaps<br>
    a wooden chair coated entirely in moss. with a chunky cushion made entirely of moss

    <br><br>perhaps<br>
    an all white room. with a sphere hanging from the middle, that explodes colours all over the walls

    <br><br>perhaps<br>
    a lightbulb in the centre of a glass sphere, as translucent paint runs around the glass, and the colours are projected all around the room

    <br><br>perhaps<br>
    a traditionally shaped castle, made entirely of geometrically patterned cards

    <br><br>perhaps<br>
    a jigsaw puzzle of entirely blank white pieces

    <br><br>perhaps<br>
    a naked man surrounded by masses of mouse traps fixed to the ground

    <br><br>perhaps<br>
    the box of a computer made entirely of full transparent glass. if all electronics had a transparent chassis

    <br><br>perhaps<br>
    a time lapse of ivy over a large period of time as it grows across a wall

    <br><br>perhaps<br>
    a bath of fish. and an assortment of other objects

    <br><br>perhaps<br>
    scissors you could wear on your fingers

    <br><br>...<br>
    or perhaps not
